# Eat-Da-Burger
Burger Logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize ORM - Homework #13

Eat-Da-Burger! is a full stack restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. When a user submits a burger, the burger name is displayed on the left side of the page. It is waiting to be devoured as shown with the 'Devour It!' button.

When the user clicks the button, the burger moves to the right side of the page.

The database stores all the burger information in a database so all data is persistent.

Please refer to the video below for details regarding how the app works.
